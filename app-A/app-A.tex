\chapter{Singular Homology and Cohomology}\label{app:A}
This appendix will give brief proofs of a number of theorems concerning singular cohomology theory which are needed in the text. To fix our notations and our sign conventions, we will start with basic definitions. Nevertheless we will assume some familiarity with homology\index{homology} and cohomology\index{cohomology} theory. In particular we will assume that the reader is acquainted with those fundamental properties which are summarised in the \cite{eilenbergsteenrod1952} axioms. 

Since these lectures were first given, several texts have appeared which present cohomology theory at the level we need, notably \cite{hilton1967homology}, \cite{spanier1981} and \cite{dold1972}.
